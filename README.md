# Codegen

This is simple code generator that uses Stencil as template language and as input you can provide a context using a YAML, JSON or PLIST file.

Codegen is helpful for the cases that you have to autogenerate code, but as input, you can't use your source code. For instance, you can define a yml with a list of feature flags and from then, autogenerate all code related using Codegen.

If you can use your source code as input, you can use [Sourcery](https://github.com/krzysztofzablocki/Sourcery).

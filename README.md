# Codegen

This is simple code generator that uses Stencil as template language and as input you can provide a context using a YAML, JSON or PLIST file.

Codegen is helpful for the cases that you have to autogenerate code, but as input, you can't use the source code. If you have to use your source code as input, you can just use [Sourcery](https://github.com/krzysztofzablocki/Sourcery).

For instance, you can define a yml with a list of feature flags and from then, autogenerate all code related using Codegen.
